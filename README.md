# 🎬 Movie Recommendation App Using ML

This is a Movie Recommendation web application that utilizes Machine Learning techniques to suggest movies based on user preferences. The app provides two main features: Movie Recommendations 🍿 and Director Recommendations 👤.

## Features

- **Movie Recommendations 🎥**: Get movie recommendations based on your preferences and user ratings. The app uses machine learning models, particularly `scikit-learn`'s CountVectorizer and cosine similarity to generate personalized movie recommendations.

- **Director Recommendations 🎞️**: Discover information about your favorite movie directors. You can explore details about their careers, popular films, and biographies.

- **Image Fetching 📷**: The app fetches movie and director images from The Movie Database (TMDb) API to provide a visually appealing user experience.
